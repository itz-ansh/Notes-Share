**break** statement:  
Immediately exits the loop when a specific condition is met.
                    OR
Terminates the loop.
                    OR
The break statement in C is used to exit a loop (like for, while, or do-while) or to terminate a switch case early. Once break is encountered, control is immediately transferred to the statement following the loop or switch structure.


Eg1) while loop

int main() 
{
    int i = 1;

    // Using break in a while loop
    while (i <= 10) 
    {
        if (i == 4) 
        {
            printf("Number 4 found, breaking out of the loop.\n");
            break;  // Exit the loop when i equals 4
        }
        printf("i = %d\n", i);
        i++;
    }

    printf("Exited the while loop.\n");

    return 0;
}

Output:

i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
Number 4 found, breaking out of the loop.
Exited the while loop.

Explanation:
--> The loop starts with i = 1 and increments i with each iteration.
--> When i == 4, the break statement is triggered, causing the while loop to exit immediately.
--> This example shows how to terminate a while loop early when a specific condition is met.


Eg2) for loop

int main() 
{
    // Using break in a for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) 
    {
        if (i == 5) 
        {
            printf("Number 5 found, breaking out of the loop.\n");
            break;  // Exit the loop when i equals 5
        }
        printf("i = %d\n", i);
    }

    printf("Exited the for loop.\n");

    return 0;
}

Output:

i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
Number 5 found, breaking out of the loop.
Exited the for loop.

Explanation:
The break statement is used when i == 5, causing the loop to terminate early.
Do-While Loop: The break statement exits the loop when i == 7, stopping the loop from continuing.


Eg3) do while loop

int main() 
{
    int i = 1;

    // Using break in a do-while loop
    do {
        if (i == 7) 
        {
            printf("Number 7 found, breaking out of the loop.\n");
            break;  // Exit the loop when i equals 7
        }
        printf("i = %d\n", i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 10);

    printf("Exited the do-while loop.\n");

    return 0;
}

Output:

i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
i = 6
Number 7 found, breaking out of the loop.
Exited the do-while loop.

Explanation:
The break statement exits the loop when i == 7, stopping the loop from continuing.
