**global variable** 

a) It is a variable that is declared outside of all functions, typically at the top of the program, and is accessible from any function within the same program (or file). 

b) Global variables are available throughout the entire lifetime of the program, meaning they retain their value between function calls.

--> Key points about global variables in C:-

1) Scope: A global variable has a global scope, meaning it can be accessed by any function in the same file where it is declared.

2) Lifetime: It is allocated memory when the program starts and is deallocated when the program terminates.

3) Declaration: It is declared outside of all functions, usually at the top of the source file.

4) Default value: If uninitialized, a global variable is automatically initialized to 0 (for basic data types like int, float, etc.).

5) Modification: Any function can modify the value of a global variable, which can sometimes lead to unintended side effects.


Imp Example and Result:

// Global variable declaration
int globalVar = 10;

void function1() 
{
    globalVar += 5;  // Modifying the global variable
    printf("Value of globalVar in function1: %d\n", globalVar);
}

void function2() 
{
    globalVar *= 2;  // Modifying the global variable
    printf("Value of globalVar in function2: %d\n", globalVar);
}

int main() 
{
    printf("Initial value of globalVar: %d\n", globalVar);
    
    function1();  // Call function1
    function2();  // Call function2
    
    printf("Final value of globalVar in main: %d\n", globalVar);
    
    return 0;
}

Output:

Initial value of globalVar: 10
Value of globalVar in function1: 15
Value of globalVar in function2: 30
Final value of globalVar in main: 30

In this example, globalVar is a global variable accessible and modifiable by both function1 and function2. Each function can change its value, which persists across different function calls.
This is because global variables have static storage duration, meaning they are created when the program starts and persist until the program terminates.

Result:-
**Any modification made to a global variable in one function will affect its value globally, and that change will be visible to all other functions.**



**ImpNote**
Local variable is always preferred over global variable.

Eg)

int i = 10;  // global i
main()
{
    int i = 5;  // local i
    // local i will have more priority than global i or local i would be preferred over global i

    i = i + 6; // i = 5 + 6 = 11
    printf("Updated value of i = %d", i);
}

Output:
Updated value of i = 11
