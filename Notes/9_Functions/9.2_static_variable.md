**static variable**

In C programming, a static variable inside a function retains its value between multiple function calls. Normally, local variables within a function are created, initialized, and destroyed with each function call. However, a static variable is initialized only once, and its value persists throughout the lifetime of the program, even though its scope is limited to the function in which it is declared.


Syntax:-

    static data_type variable_name = value;



**Characteristics of a Static Variable:-**

Persistence: The value of the static variable persists between function calls.

Scope: The static variable has local scope (it can be accessed only within the function where it is defined).

Initialization: The static variable is initialized only once. If not explicitly initialized, it is automatically initialized to 0.

Storage Class: The storage class of a static variable is "static," meaning it is stored in a fixed location (global memory).


Eg1) 

void counter() 
{
    static int count = 0;  // Static variable initialized only once
    count++;  // Increment the static variable
    printf("Count: %d\n", count);
}

int main() 
{
    counter();  // Call the function
    counter();  // Call the function again
    counter();  // Call the function once more
    return 0;
}

Output:

Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3

Explanation:
The variable count is declared as static, so its value persists between function calls.
In each function call, the value of count is incremented by 1.
Unlike a normal local variable, count is not re-initialized to 0 in each function call.


Eg2) Without Static Variable (For Comparison)

void counter() 
{
    int count = 0;  // Regular local variable
    count++;  // Increment the local variable
    printf("Count: %d\n", count);
}

int main() 
{
    counter();  // Call the function
    counter();  // Call the function again
    counter();  // Call the function once more
    return 0;
}

Output:

Count: 1
Count: 1
Count: 1

Explanation:
In this example, count is a regular local variable, so it is re-initialized to 0 every time the function is called, and thus, the output remains the same in each function call.


**Key Takeaways:-**

A static variable is useful when you need a local variable whose value should be retained across multiple function calls.
It allows you to create functions that can "remember" state information between calls.
