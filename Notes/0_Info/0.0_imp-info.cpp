In Visual Studio Code, you can use multiple cursors to edit or move statements by following these steps:

To add multiple cursors:
Click and Drag with Alt (Windows/Linux) or Option (Mac):

Hold down the Alt key (or Option on Mac), then click and drag to create multiple cursors in different lines.
Add Cursors on Multiple Lines:

Place your cursor on a line and press Ctrl + Alt + Down Arrow (or Command + Option + Down Arrow on Mac) to add a cursor below.
Press Ctrl + Alt + Up Arrow (or Command + Option + Up Arrow on Mac) to add a cursor above.
Select Multiple Occurrences of Text:

Select the text and press Ctrl + D (or Command + D on Mac) to select the next occurrence of the same text.
You can keep pressing Ctrl + D to keep adding occurrences to your selection.
Select All Occurrences of a Word:

Select a word and press Ctrl + Shift + L (or Command + Shift + L on Mac) to select all instances of that word in the current file.
Moving Text with Multiple Cursors:
Once you have selected the lines or instances you want to edit, move the statements using Alt + Up Arrow or Alt + Down Arrow (on both Windows/Linux) or Option + Up Arrow or Option + Down Arrow (on Mac) to shift the text up or down line by line.
This will allow you to easily move and edit multiple lines of code simultaneously!
