Here is a detailed list and description of all the format specifiers in C, which are used with functions like printf, scanf, and related functions to specify the type of data being handled.

1) Basic Format Specifiers for Integers:

Format Specifier            	Description	                            Example Value

%d	                        Signed decimal integer	                     42, -100, 0
%i	                        Signed decimal integer (same as %d)	         42, -100, 0
%u	                        Unsigned decimal integer	                 42, 100
%o	                        Unsigned octal number	                     052 (octal for 42)
%x	                        Unsigned hexadecimal (lowercase)	         2a (hex for 42)
%X	                        Unsigned hexadecimal (uppercase)	         2A (hex for 42)


**Note**
In C, both %d and %i are format specifiers used for integers, and while they seem similar, they have subtle differences in certain contexts.

a) Usage in printf() (Output):

In the context of printf(), %d and %i are practically the same. Both are used to print signed decimal integers.

Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    printf("%d\n", num);  // Prints: 42
    printf("%i\n", num);  // Prints: 42
    return 0;
}
Output:
42
42

In this case, there is no difference between %d and %i when using printf(). Both display the integer value in decimal format.

b)  Usage in scanf() (Input):

In the context of scanf(), %d and %i have different behavior when reading input.

%d: Reads input as a signed decimal integer.
%i: Can detect the base of the input and convert accordingly:

Decimal if the input starts with a non-zero digit.
Octal if the input starts with 0.
Hexadecimal if the input starts with 0x or 0X.

Example with scanf():

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%i", &num);  // Try entering 42, 052 (octal), or 0x2A (hexadecimal)
    printf("You entered: %d\n", num);

    return 0;
}

Input:
0x2A  (This is hexadecimal for 42)

Output:
You entered: 42

If you use %i in scanf(), it will correctly interpret the number as hexadecimal. On the other hand, if you used %d, it would treat the input only as decimal and would not interpret 0x or leading zeros as anything special.

Summary:-

%d: Always treats the input or output as a signed decimal integer, whether in printf() or scanf().

%i:
In printf(), it behaves the same as %d (prints a signed decimal integer).
In scanf(), it interprets the input as decimal, octal, or hexadecimal based on the input format:
--> Decimal: 42
--> Octal: 052 (leading zero)
--> Hexadecimal: 0x2A (leading 0x)


2) Floating-Point Format Specifiers:

Format Specifier               	Description	                            Example Value

%f	                        Decimal floating-point	                      3.141593
%e	                        Scientific notation (lowercase)	             3.141593e+00
%E	                        Scientific notation (uppercase)	             3.141593E+00
%g	                        Shorter of %e or %f	                            3.14
%G	                        Shorter of %E or %f	                            3.14
%a	                        Hexadecimal floating-point (lowercase)	     0x1.91eb86p+1
%A	                        Hexadecimal floating-point (uppercase)	     0X1.91EB86P+1


3) Character and String Format Specifiers:

Format Specifier            	Description	                Example Value

%c	                          Single character	                'A', 'b'
%s	                          Null-terminated string	     "Hello, world!"


4) Pointer Format Specifiers:

Format Specifier	            Description	                Example Value

%p	                          Pointer address	            0x7fff5fbff8b0


5) Length Modifiers:

You can specify the size of integer types by using length modifiers with the basic format specifiers.

Modifier	         Format Specifier	         Description     	                Example Value

h	                    %hd, %hu    	Short integer (signed/unsigned)	            32767, 65535
l	                    %ld, %lu	    Long integer (signed/unsigned)	        2147483647, 4294967295
ll	                    %lld, %llu	   Long long integer (signed/unsigned)        9223372036854775807
L	                    %Lf	           Long double (floating-point)                  3.141593


6) Special Format Specifiers:

Format Specifier	        Description	                          Example Value

%%	                   Prints a percent sign %	                        %
%n	                Stores the number of characters printed       Integer value
                    so far into a variable.

**Note**
The %n format specifier in C is quite unique and works differently compared to other format specifiers. It does not print anything to the output. Instead, it stores the number of characters printed so far by printf() into a variable.

Eg. 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int count1, count2;

    // Printing some text and using %n to store the number of characters printed

    printf("Hello, World!%n", &count1); 
    // The count of characters printed until this point is stored in count1
    printf("\nNumber of characters printed until now: %d\n", count1);

    // Continuing to print more text

    printf("Learning C programming.%n", &count2); 
    // The count of characters printed until this point is stored in count2
    printf("\nTotal number of characters printed: %d\n", count2);

    return 0;
}

Explanation:

--> The first printf("Hello, World!%n", &count1) prints "Hello, World!" and then stores the number of characters printed (which is 13) into count1.
--> The second printf("Learning C programming.%n", &count2) prints "Learning C programming." and then stores the number of characters printed (up to this point, which is 34) into count2.

Output:

Hello, World!
Number of characters printed until now: 13
Learning C programming.
Total number of characters printed: 34

**Key Points about %n:**

a) %n does not print anything.
b) It stores the total number of characters that have been printed up to the point where %n appears into the provided variable.
c) %n is mainly used for debugging or tracking the number of characters printed in more complex formatting scenarios.

**Important Note:**
The use of %n should be handled carefully since it modifies memory, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities if not used correctly. Some compilers and environments may also issue warnings when %n is used due to security concerns.


7) Width and Precision Modifiers:
You can control how the output is formatted using width and precision modifiers.


Width:
Specifies the minimum number of characters to be printed. If the output is shorter than the specified width, it will be padded with spaces.

Format Specifier              	Description	                        Example Value

%10d	           Print at least 10 characters (right-aligned)           42
%-10d	           Print at least 10 characters (left-aligned)	          42

**Note** 
      %nd --> prints atleast n characters (rights aligned)   
      %-nd --> prints atleast n characters (left aligned)


      %nf --> Reserves n spaces for floating-point numbers
                                 OR
              Right-aligns a floating-point number in a field of at least n characters wide.
      %-nf --> Left-aligns the floating-point number in a field that is at least n characters wide.


      %ns  --> Right-aligns a string within a field that is at least n characters wide.
               If the string is shorter than n characters, it will be padded with spaces on the left.
      %-ns --> Left-aligns a string within a field that is at least n characters wide.
               If the string is shorter than n characters, it will be padded with spaces on the right.


Precision:
For floating-point numbers, precision specifies the number of digits after the decimal point. For strings, it specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed.

Format Specifier	            Description	                        Example Value

%.2f	              Print 2 digits after decimal point	             3.14
%.5s	              Print at most 5 characters from a string       	 Hello

**Note** 
      %.nf --> prints n digits after decimal point
      %.ns --> prints atmost n characters from a string

**Note** 
      %n.mf: Combines both width (n) and decimal precision (m)
      %-n.mf: Left-aligns the floating-point number


8) Scanning (Input) Specifiers in scanf:
Similar to printf, format specifiers are used with scanf to read input, but they often work slightly differently.

Format Specifier	                  Description	             Example Usage

%d	                          Read a signed decimal integer	     scanf("%d", &i);
%i	                          Read a signed integer	             scanf("%i", &i);
%u	                          Read an unsigned decimal integer   scanf("%u", &u);
%f	                                Read a float	             scanf("%f", &f);
%lf	                                Read a double	             scanf("%lf", &d);
%c	                          Read a single character	         scanf("%c", &ch);
%s	                          Read a string (until whitespace)	 scanf("%s", str);
%p	                          Read a pointer address	         scanf("%p", &ptr);


9) Additional Format Specifiers (GNU Extensions):

Some additional format specifiers are available in the GNU C library for advanced or platform-specific use cases.

Format Specifier	                 Description                	Example Value

%F	                          Alternative for %f (fixed-point)	      3.141593
%C	                               Wide character	                  L'„ÅÇ'
%S	                               Wide string	                      L"Hello"



Example Code Demonstrating Various Format Specifiers:-

Eg1) 

int main() {
    int i = 42;
    unsigned int u = 300;
    float f = 3.14159;
    double d = 2.71828;
    char c = 'A';
    char str[] = "Hello, World!";
    int *ptr = &i;

    // Output examples using different format specifiers
    printf("Integer (%%d): %d\n", i);
    printf("Unsigned integer (%%u): %u\n", u);
    printf("Float (%%f): %.2f\n", f);
    printf("Double (%%lf): %.5lf\n", d);
    printf("Character (%%c): %c\n", c);
    printf("String (%%s): %s\n", str);
    printf("Pointer (%%p): %p\n", (void*)ptr);
    printf("Hexadecimal (%%x): %x\n", i);
    
    return 0;
}

Sample Output:

perl
Copy code
Integer (%d): 42
Unsigned integer (%u): 300
Float (%f): 3.14
Double (%lf): 2.71828
Character (%c): A
String (%s): Hello, World!
Pointer (%p): 0x7ffc9a32d64c
Hexadecimal (%x): 2a



Eg2)

Here's a C program that incorporates all the specified format specifiers: 
%nd, %-nd, %nf, %-nf, %.nf, %n.mf, %-n.mf, %ns, %-ns, and %.ns
The program demonstrates formatting for integers, floating-point numbers, and strings:-

int main() {
    // Declare variables for integers, floating-point numbers, and strings
    int int1 = 42, int2 = 12345;
    float float1 = 3.14159, float2 = 123.45678;
    char str1[] = "Hello";
    char str2[] = "World!";

    // Using %nd (right-align integers)
    printf("Right-aligned integers:\n");
    printf("%5d\n", int1);  // Right-align with a width of 5
    printf("%8d\n", int2);  // Right-align with a width of 8

    // Using %-nd (left-align integers)
    printf("\nLeft-aligned integers:\n");
    printf("%-5d\n", int1);  // Left-align with a width of 5
    printf("%-8d\n", int2);  // Left-align with a width of 8

    // Using %nf (right-align floating-point numbers)
    printf("\nRight-aligned floating-point numbers:\n");
    printf("%8f\n", float1);  // Right-align with a width of 8
    printf("%10f\n", float2); // Right-align with a width of 10

    // Using %-nf (left-align floating-point numbers)
    printf("\nLeft-aligned floating-point numbers:\n");
    printf("%-8f\n", float1);  // Left-align with a width of 8
    printf("%-10f\n", float2); // Left-align with a width of 10

    // Using %.nf (floating-point with precision)
    printf("\nFloating-point with precision (%.2f):\n");
    printf("%.2f\n", float1);   // 2 decimal places
    printf("%.4f\n", float2);   // 4 decimal places

    // Using %n.mf (floating-point with width and precision)
    printf("\nFloating-point with width and precision (%10.3f):\n");
    printf("%10.3f\n", float1);   // Width of 10, 3 decimal places
    printf("%10.1f\n", float2);   // Width of 10, 1 decimal place

    // Using %-n.mf (left-aligned floating-point with width and precision)
    printf("\nLeft-aligned floating-point with width and precision (%-10.3f):\n");
    printf("%-10.3f\n", float1);   // Left-align, width of 10, 3 decimal places
    printf("%-10.1f\n", float2);   // Left-align, width of 10, 1 decimal place

    // Using %ns (right-align strings)
    printf("\nRight-aligned strings:\n");
    printf("%10s\n", str1); // Right-align "Hello" in a field of width 10
    printf("%15s\n", str2); // Right-align "World!" in a field of width 15

    // Using %-ns (left-align strings)
    printf("\nLeft-aligned strings:\n");
    printf("%-10s\n", str1); // Left-align "Hello" in a field of width 10
    printf("%-15s\n", str2); // Left-align "World!" in a field of width 15

    // Using %.ns (truncate strings)
    printf("\nTruncated strings:\n");
    printf("%.5s\n", str1); // Print first 5 characters of "Hello"
    printf("%.7s\n", str2); // Print first 7 characters of "World!"

    return 0;
}


Explanation of the Code:

Integer Formatting:

--> Right Alignment: Uses %nd to print integers right-aligned in specified widths.
--> Left Alignment: Uses %-nd to print integers left-aligned in specified widths.

Floating-Point Formatting:

--> Right Alignment: Uses %nf for right-aligning floating-point numbers.
--> Left Alignment: Uses %-nf for left-aligning floating-point numbers.
--> Precision: Uses %.nf to control the number of decimal places.

Floating-Point with Width and Precision:

--> Uses %n.mf for formatting floating-point numbers with both width and precision.
--> Uses %-n.mf for left-aligning floating-point numbers with specified width and precision.

String Formatting:

--> Right Alignment: Uses %ns to print strings right-aligned within specified widths.
--> Left Alignment: Uses %-ns for left-aligned strings.
--> Truncation: Uses %.ns to limit the number of characters printed from the strings.
