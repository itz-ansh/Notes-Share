1) Arithmetic Operators:- 

These operators perform basic arithmetic operations.

Operator	    Description	            Example

+                Addition	             a + b
-	            Subtraction     	     a - b
*	           Multiplication   	     a * b
/	              Division      	     a / b
%	           Modulus (remainder)	     a % b



2) Relational Operators or Comparison Operators:-

Compare two values and return a boolean result (true/false)

Operator	   Description	             Example

==	             Equal to	             a == b
!=	           Not equal to	             a != b
>	           Greater than	             a > b
<	             Less than	             a < b
>=	         Greater than or equal to	 a >= b
<=	         Less than or equal to	     a <= b



3) Logical Operators:-

a) These are used to perform logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).
b) Returns a boolean result (true/false)

Operator	      Description	  Example

&&	              Logical AND	  a && b
||		`         Logical OR      a || b
!	              Logical NOT	    !a


Logical AND (&&): This operator returns true if both operands are non-zero (true). It's commonly used when you want to ensure that two conditions are met before proceeding with a block of code.

Logical OR (||): This operator returns true if at least one of the operands is non-zero (true). It's useful when you want to proceed when any one of multiple conditions is met.

Logical NOT (!): This operator inverts the truth value of its operand. If the operand is non-zero (true), it returns false, and vice versa.

**ImpNote**
Non-zero number --> True
Zero --> False



4) Bitwise Operators:-

Perform bit-level operations on integers for tasks like setting or clearing bits.
Bitwise operators are fundamental to systems programming, enabling manipulation of data at the bit level, which can lead to more efficient code. These operators are used to perform operations on binary representations of numbers, where the operations are carried out bit by bit.

Operator	          Description	                            Example

&	                  Bitwise AND	                             a & b
|	                  Bitwise OR                                 a | b
^	                  Bitwise XOR	                             a ^ b
~	                  Bitwise NOT	                               ~a
<<	                  Left shift (shifts bits to the left)	     a << 2
>>	                  Right shift (shifts bits to the right)	 a >> 2


Bitwise AND (&): This operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if both bits in the compared position of the operands are 1.

Bitwise OR (|): It compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 if at least one of the bits at the same position is 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): This operator also compares each bit of two numbers, but it returns 1 only if the bits in the compared positions are different.

Bitwise NOT (~): The NOT operator inverts all the bits of its operand, turning 1s into 0s and vice versa.


Shift Operators:

In addition to these, there are shift operators that move bits to the left or right within a binary number:

Left Shift (<<): This operator shifts the bits of the first operand to the left. The number of places to shift is determined by the second operand. It's equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 to the power of the shift count.

Right Shift (>>): It shifts the bits of the first operand to the right. For signed numbers, this is an arithmetic shift, which means it preserves the sign of the number. For unsigned numbers, it's a logical shift.



5) Assignment Operators:-

Assign values to variables and can also perform operations like addition or multiplication during assignment.

Operator	    Description	             Example

=	            Assignment	             a = b
+=	            Add and assign	         a += b (same as a = a + b)
-=	            Subtract and assign	     a -= b (same as a = a - b)
*=	            Multiply and assign	     a *= b (same as a = a * b)
/=	            Divide and assign	     a /= b (same as a = a / b)
%=	            Modulus and assign	     a %= b (same as a = a % b)



6) Increment/Decrement Operators:-

Increase or decrease a variable’s value by 1.

Operator	     Description	    Example

++	            Increment by 1	   ++a or a++
--	            Decrement by 1	   --a or a--


a++  --> post increment --> increment on next line
++a  --> pre increment --> increment on same line

a--  --> post decrement --> decrement on next line
--a  --> pre decrement --> decrement on same line



7) Conditional (Ternary) Operator:-

A shorthand way to write an if-else condition.

Operator	        Description	                                          Example

? :	    Conditional evaluation (ternary operator)	  a ? b : c (if a is true, returns b; else returns c)


Eg. Here’s a simple C program using the conditional (ternary) operator to find the largest of two numbers:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a, b, max;

    // Input two numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    // Use conditional (ternary) operator to find the largest number
    max = (a > b) ? a : b;

    // Output the result
    printf("The largest number is: %d\n", max);

    return 0;
}

Explanation:
a) The ternary operator (a > b) ? a : b; checks if a is greater than b.
b) If true, it returns a; otherwise, it returns b.
c) The result is stored in the variable max, and then it's printed.



8) Comma Operator:-

Operator	         Description	                               Example

,	          Separates multiple expressions	   a = (b = 2, b + 1) (Evaluates b=2 first, then b+1)

Eg.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int i, j;

    // Using comma operator in the initialization and iteration sections of the for loop
    for(i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) 
    {
        printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, j);
    }

    return 0;
}

Explaination:
a) In the for loop, the comma operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in both the initialization (i = 0, j = 10) and the iteration (i++, j--) sections.
b) The loop increments i and decrements j simultaneously until i is no longer less than j.
c) The comma operator ensures both expressions are executed in sequence.



9) Pointer Operators:-

Work with memory addresses by dereferencing pointers or finding the address of a variable.

Operator	        Description           	            Example

*	            Dereference operator	    *ptr (Access the value pointed by ptr)
&	             Address of operator	    &a (Returns the address of variable a)


Eg. Here’s a simple C program demonstrating the use of pointer operators (* for dereferencing and & for getting the address):

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int num = 10;
    int *ptr;  // Pointer declaration

    // Assigning the address of num to ptr
    ptr = &num;

    // Printing the address of num and value using the pointer
    printf("Address of num: %p\n", ptr);
    printf("Value of num using pointer: %d\n", *ptr);

    return 0;
}

Explanation:
a) &num: This gets the address of the variable num and stores it in the pointer ptr.
b) *ptr: This dereferences the pointer ptr, accessing the value stored at the memory location ptr is pointing to, which is num's value.
c) The program prints both the address and the value of num using pointer operators.



10) sizeof Operator:-

Returns the size (in bytes) of a data type or variable.

Operator	                 Description	            Example

sizeof                 	Returns size in bytes	       sizeof(a)


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Using sizeof with basic data types
    printf("Size of char: %lu byte\n", sizeof(char));
    printf("Size of int: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(int));
    printf("Size of float: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(float));
    printf("Size of double: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(double));

    // Using sizeof with a variable
    int num = 42;
    printf("Size of variable 'num': %lu bytes\n", sizeof(num));

    // Using sizeof with arrays
    int arr[10];
    printf("Size of array 'arr': %lu bytes\n", sizeof(arr));
    printf("Size of one element in array 'arr': %lu bytes\n", sizeof(arr[0]));
    
    // Calculate the number of elements in the array
    printf("Number of elements in array 'arr': %lu\n", sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]));

    return 0;
}

Sample Output (may vary depending on the system):

Size of char: 1 byte
Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of float: 4 bytes
Size of double: 8 bytes
Size of variable 'num': 4 bytes
Size of array 'arr': 40 bytes
Size of one element in array 'arr': 4 bytes
Number of elements in array 'arr': 10
This program shows how to use the sizeof operator to find the sizes of various data types and objects.

Explanation:

a) sizeof(char), sizeof(int), sizeof(float), sizeof(double): These expressions calculate the size of basic data types in bytes.
b) sizeof(num): Calculates the size of the variable num, which is of type int.
c) sizeof(arr): Calculates the total size of the array arr (10 elements of type int).
d) sizeof(arr[0]): Calculates the size of one element of the array (which is of type int).
e) **Calculating the number of elements in the array:** By dividing the total size of the array by the size of one element, you get the number of elements in the array.

Eg. a short C program that calculates the number of elements in an array by dividing the total size of the array by the size of one element.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    // Declare an array of integers
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

    // Calculate the number of elements in the array
    int totalSize = sizeof(arr);            // Total size of the array in bytes
    int elementSize = sizeof(arr[0]);       // Size of one element in bytes
    int numElements = totalSize / elementSize;  // Number of elements in the array

    // Output the result
    printf("Total number of elements in the array: %d\n", numElements);

    return 0;
}

Output:

Total number of elements in the array: 10

Explanation:

a) sizeof(arr) gives the total size of the array in bytes.
b) sizeof(arr[0]) gives the size of a single element in the array (in this case, an int).
c) By dividing the total size of the array by the size of a single element, we calculate the number of elements in the array.

**This approach is especially useful when working with arrays whose size might not be known explicitly.**



11) Member Access Operators:-

Access members (fields) of structures or unions directly or through pointers.

Operator	            Description	                  Example

.	            Access structure/union member	   struct.member
->	              Access member via pointer	        ptr->member



12) Type Cast Operator:- 

Converts a value from one data type to another.

Operator	        Description	                         Example

(type)	     Casts a value to another type	     (int) a (Casts a to int)


Eg1) 

main()
{
  int i = 5;
  float x = float(i);
  printf("%f",x);
}

       OR

main()
{
  int i = 5;
  float x = (float)i;
  printf("%f",x);
}


Eg2)

int main() 
{
    float num = 5.75;
    int int_num;

    // Using type casting to convert float to int
    int_num = (int) num;

    // Printing original float and the casted integer
    printf("Original float value: %.2f\n", num);
    printf("After type casting to int: %d\n", int_num);

    return 0;
}

Output:

Original float value: 5.75
After type casting to int: 5
