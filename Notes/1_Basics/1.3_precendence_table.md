In C, operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. Associativity defines how operators of the same precedence level are grouped in the absence of parentheses. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first, and operators of the same precedence level are evaluated according to their associativity.

Here is the C operator precedence and associativity table from highest to lowest precedence:
