1) Recursion: It is a function which calls itself.

2) Recurrence relation: Recursion jiski value kam hi hoti rehti hai and has a
                        base condition or inductive condition.


Common examples of recurrence relation:-
a) Tower of Hanoi
b) Factorial of a number
c) Fibonacci series


Observe:-

Eg.   f(n) = n x f(n+1)   --> this is a recursion but NOT a recurrence relation
