While entering the string using scanf( ) we must be cautious about
two things:

a)The length of the string should not exceed the dimension of
the character array. This is because the C compiler doesnâ€™t
perform bounds checking on character arrays. Hence, if you
carelessly exceed the bounds there is always a danger of
overwriting something important, and in that event, you
would have nobody to blame but yourselves.

b) scanf( ) is not capable of receiving multi-word strings.
Therefore names such as 'Ansh Kumar' would be unacceptable. 

Example:- 

main()
{
 char name[25] ;
 printf ("Enter your name: ") ;
 scanf ("%s", name) ;
 printf ("Hello %s!", name) ;
}
Input:-   Ansh Kumar
Output:-  Ansh

--> The way to get around this limitation is by using 
    the function **gets( )**. The usage of functions gets( ) and
    its counterpart **puts( )** is shown in next file. 


**Note**

main( )
{
    char name[25];
    printf ("Enter your full name: ");
    gets(name);
    puts ("Hello!");
    puts(name);
}

This code works, but there are some issues and best practices you should be aware of:

* Problem of using gets()

--> The function gets() is unsafe and has been deprecated in modern versions of C (removed in C11) because it doesn't perform bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflows if the input exceeds the size of the array.

-->  Use fgets() Instead of gets()
To avoid potential buffer overflow, you should use fgets() instead of gets(). The fgets() function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read, preventing overflows.

                    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);

name: The array where the input will be stored.

sizeof(name): Ensures that at most 24 characters are read, leaving space for the null terminator ('\0').

stdin: Reads from the standard input.


// Modified Code Using fgets():

int main() 
{
    char name[25];
    printf("Enter your full name: ");
    
    // Use fgets instead of gets to prevent overflow
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    
    puts("Hello!");
    puts(name);
    
    return 0;
}
