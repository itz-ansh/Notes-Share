// Reading a string


//Method 1 --> with the concept of indexing

// main()
// {
//     /* The string str[5] is used here only to store 4 characters, and the last index (str[4]) 
//        is reserved for the null terminator ('\0') to make it a valid C string. */

//     char str[5];  // Array size is 5, but we will read 4 characters to leave space for null terminator.
//                   // Array size = 5 --> 4 characters + 1 null terminator ('\0')

//     printf("Enter the string: ");
//     for (int i=0; i<4; i++)    // Read 4 characters
//         scanf(" %c", &str[i]);  // No space after %c, just before to skip preceding whitespaces

//     printf("The string is: ");
//     for (int i=0; i<4; i++)
//         printf("%c", str[i]);  // Print each character
//                                // ImpNote:   printf() doesn’t print the '\0'
// }




//Method 2 --> direct

main( )
{
 char name[25] ;
 printf ("Enter your name: ") ;
 scanf ("%s", name) ;  // No need for '&'
 printf ("Hello %s!", name) ;   
}



/*
In the code you provided, you do not need to use the & (address-of operator) in scanf() when reading a string (character array) like name. This is because the name of an array in C already acts as a pointer to its first element.

Explanation:
For variables (like int, float, etc.), you need to use & to pass the address of the variable to scanf(), so it knows where to store the input.

Example: scanf("%d", &x); for an integer x.
For arrays, the array name (name) itself is treated as a pointer to the first element of the array. So, when you pass name to scanf(), it already points to the location where the input should be stored.

Why no & for arrays?
char name[25]; declares an array that can hold up to 24 characters (the 25th element is reserved for the null terminator \0).
The array name (name) is equivalent to the memory address of the first character (&name[0]), so you don't need &name in scanf(). Just using name is enough.
Correct Code:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char name[25];
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);  // No need for '&'
    printf("Hello %s!\n", name);
    return 0;
}
Key Point:
For arrays (strings), name is already a pointer, so no need to use & in scanf().

Yes, using &name (or &name[0]) in scanf("%s", ...) would result in a compilation error or undefined behavior. Here’s why:

What Happens if You Use &name in scanf():
name is already a pointer to the first element of the array (name is equivalent to &name[0]).
Using &name in scanf("%s", &name) would result in a pointer to a pointer (i.e., the address of the array itself, not the first element of the array). This is not what scanf() expects.
Example:
c
Copy code
char name[25];
scanf("%s", &name);  // WRONG: &name gives the address of the entire array
In this case:

&name points to the entire array (i.e., a pointer to the array itself), not the address of the first character (&name[0] or simply name).
scanf("%s", ...) expects a char* (a pointer to a character), but you are passing a pointer to the entire array, which causes type mismatch.
Possible Outcomes:
Compilation Error: The compiler may complain about the type mismatch, like:

lua
Copy code
error: format '%s' expects argument of type 'char*', but argument 2 has type 'char (*)[25]'
Undefined Behavior: In some cases, the program might compile but result in undefined behavior when executed. It might cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Conclusion:
Using &name in scanf("%s", &name) is incorrect because &name is a pointer to the array, but scanf("%s", ...) expects a pointer to the first character of the array. Always use just name in this case, as it already acts as a pointer to the first element.
